# tic-tac-toe
This repository contains a C++ code for a **tic tac toe** game with the computer.

Moves played by the computer are randomly generated.\
Feel free to use and make changes to the code.


## How to Play?
1). Enter the Name you want to play with.\
2). The 'Player' always plays first with 'X' tile.\
3). The grid numbering starts with '1'.\
4). The goal is to get three of your marks in a continuous line, which can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\
5). If a player achieves three in a row, they win the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player nor the computer has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
